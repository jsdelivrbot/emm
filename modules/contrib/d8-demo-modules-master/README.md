The `demo` module contains updated code discussed in the following articles:

* [Build a Drupal 8 Module: Routing, Controllers and Menu Links](http://www.sitepoint.com/build-drupal-8-module-routing-controllers-menu-links/)
* [Building a Drupal 8 Module: Blocks and Forms](http://www.sitepoint.com/building-drupal-8-module-blocks-forms/)
* [Building a Drupal 8 Module â€“ Configuration Management and the Service Container](http://www.sitepoint.com/building-drupal-8-module-configuration-management-service-container/)

The `event_dispatcher_demo` module contains updated code discussed in the following article:

* [Drupal 8 Hooks and the Symfony Event Dispatcher](http://www.sitepoint.com/drupal-8-hooks-symfony-event-dispatcher/) (the `hooks` branch contains the version using hooks instead of the event dispatcher)

Do keep in mind that the code is updated and will not be exactly like in the articles, which are not updated with the latest API changes.

If you notice any outdated code that no longer works, feel free to either open an issue and let me know or submit a Pull Request.
